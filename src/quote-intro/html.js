                attending a bachelor degree from an English University while also taking multiple full-year
                trainings on Athenian private vocational institutes.

                Desktop Applications Development','Business Management and Marketing' and 'Graphics Design'.

                occupied and have been evolving my competences and communication in a

                pharmaceutical company, complying and assimilating to my profile highly strict and demanding
