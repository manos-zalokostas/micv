                            For near the last and a half decade I have been studying and practicing my skills on diverse domains of educational interest,
                            attending a bachelor degree from an English University while also taking multiple full-year trainings on Athenian private vocational institutes.
                            The aspects of my study and research could be, in an abstruct manner, summarized to 'Web and Desktop Applications Development','Business Management and Marketing' and 'Graphics Design'.
                            At the same time, speaking of my occupational experience, for more than a decade I have been occupied and have been evolving my competences and communication in a top-competent,world-wide extending
                            pharmaceutical company, complying and assimilating to my profile highly strict and demanding business procedures.

                        <p>
                            On site you may resume both of my occupational and educational timelines, how the two were drawn and evolve in parellel during previous years. Context may be indexed in detail,
                            either as bulleted descriptions or guided by an interactive timeline. Along with the descriptive context you may also have an overview on some of the most critical projects that I have encountered.
                            Therefore you may find available work-samples while working as a freelance developer on the Web, as officer occupied by pharmaceutical company, and last but not least as student at university.
