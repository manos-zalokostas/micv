 <ul>
<p>The system is originally built for providing functionality with regard to the following sections: </p>
<span>
<li>The system is an instrument for users to arrange, conduct and maintain an annual school   schedule in a relative intuitive and easy way. The users should be provided with guidance to those cases where the operation of the system is ambiguous. </li>
<li>The system will maintain hierarchically privileged accessing roles for its users, and top-privileged roles should maintain the faculty to adjust the privileges of the other user-roles.</li>
<li>The system maintains diverse accessing level sections, where sections of high importance can only be accessed by the corresponding accessing user roles, as those are imposed by administration.</li>
<li>The arrangement of the schedule can only be conducted by highly privileged roles and will be iterated automatically by the system, but verified manually by lower privileged roles, on a daily basis.</li>
</span>
<li>The schedule can override the formal arrangements or can change completely during a running semester. The system will need to easily integrate the changes and those must be provided for verification as well. </li>
<li>The informative resources of the organizations (like registered courses, tutors, campuses addresses etc) can be accessed effectively by all user roles of the system, but only authorized users will be in position to add new resources to the system. </li>
<li>The system will maintain a registry where the users interaction with the system can be monitored.</li>
<li>The system should be deployed in a secure environment and will maintain the privacy of the registered records from unauthorized users.</li>
<li><ul>The system should maintain extra faculties for top-level privileged roles as to:
<li>make overall estimations for given time-periods, based on the daily recordings</li>
<li>securely backup and/or retrieve the database data on demand</li>
</ul></li>

  <p><b>Description of the Application</b></p>
  <ul>
  <span>
        <li>The application is a unified ms access environment that delivers instantly, coherent and verbose information about all of the company employees in several distinct domains.
        </li>
  <li>Amongst all of the main pages there is a ‘search input’ that will add value while in search of data for an individual.
        </li>
        <li>All domains provide also stand-alone and multi-rows presentation of data while indexing the data.
        </li>
        <li>Maintain a registry of all the company employees with all of their company-relevant credentials.
        </li>
       </span>
       </ul>
  <p><u>The domains where the application evolves function are the following: </u></p>
        <ul>
        <li> <b> Domain: PERSONS.</b> Employee company-related credentials (name, job purpose, department, geographical area, phone/mobile, email etc.. )
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: CARS</b>. Employees training in driving skills is examined and the page incorporates elements like the ‘date’ that examination was taken, the ‘score’ that was achieved and the trainer ‘comments’ about the nominee
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: CARS</b>. The page resolves the matches between company’s cars fleet and employees. There is a adequate description of the car assigned recorded, as ‘brand’, ‘cc’, ‘color’, ‘leasing-company’, ‘car features’, ‘car km’ and ‘date bought’. Also there is the name of the driver that has been assigned the car.
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: PARKING</b>. The page resolves the parking seats of 2 different buildings and their correlation with the actual cars of company and assigned drivers (only for employees occupied in office - not sales force).  The page makes extensive use of searching operations providing 3 different domains for indexing.
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: OVERVIEW</b>. The page gathers and accumulates information from 3 distinct pages and provides a quick overview for each employee. The retrieved pages are ‘roadsafety’, ‘safetracks’ and ‘accidents’
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: ANNUAL ROADSAFETY RATES</b>. The page is applied by the HSE department due to each year ending and is a multi-rows evaluation map for each driver. The driver is evaluated from its manager and the HSE department. Next to each driver row there are buttons for quick referencing the employees driving behavior.
        </li>
        <li> <b> Domain: ACCIDENTS</b>. The page hosts information about the driving accidents that employees have encountered. Therefore the recording made are: ‘the driver’, ‘accident date’, ‘driver description’ and ‘HSE department categorization’ of the accident.
        </li>
        </ul>]]>

       <p><b>Description of the Application</b></p>
  <ul>
  <span>
        <li> The project is a Microsoft Access application that was hosted in the shared files of the company and employees could use while having the access rights on that certain folder.
        Its main purpose was to resolve the booking of the rooms provided by the company for its members for meetings.
        </li>
        <li> Employees were to apply the provided inputs and using the ‘mail’ button a report was triggered in the background to be sent to the meeting-rooms administrator.
        </li>
        <li> A number of inputs were required and others were not. Missing to apply a required input would bring up an informative message for the user while trying to save the data, alerting where the omission emerged and highlighting the input[s].
        </li>
        <li> While hovering with the mouse or focusing on an input using the keyboard ‘tab’ key, the ‘message box’ displays messages for the user informing whether the input is required or not.
        </li>
        </span>
        <li> Where the form has been applied effectively and saved, an informative message is displayed to users inform them that the registration was made.
        </li>
        <li> Saving a form, would enable the ‘preview request’ and ‘email sent’ buttons and those can further be used by the user.
        </li>
        <li> ‘preview request’ would display the report that will be sent to the administrator, while ‘email sent’ would sent it immediately without further activity by the user.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><u> Additional Benefits </u></p>
        <p>
        The initiative was taken by the department since there were numerous conflicts following the ‘phone calling’ procedure between departments and administrator. Implementing this application would effectively empower the admin to monitor and take care of the whole procedure. Likewise:
        </p>
  <ul>
        <li> We would escape any space for missing phone calls since the requests would land straight to the admin’s email.
        </li>
        <li> The admin would maintain a directory of the ‘report requests’ sent, that could be monitored with greater effectiveness than moving back to actual emails and  rolling down conversations before taking the booking decisions.
        </li>
        <li> Department delegates would never again sent emails missing any critical information since now the mail could never been sent with the regarded omissions.
        </li>
        </ul>]]>

            <![CDATA[<p>
        <span>The monthly bills statements were recorded and further indexed by Microsoft Access application, providing us with greater efficiency and speed in collecting numerous data and make more wise monitoring upon.
        The initiative was initially taken in order to monitor the physical resources consumption that was emerging within the company on a monthly basis. Additionally the querying mechanism implemented was enabling us to provide feedback for the HR Department with charts and reports due to the end of each semester.
        </p>
        <p>
        Moving a step further, as the consumption was already acknowledged, the system integrated the faculty to come up and present also the monthly expenditure for all of the consumed resources and finally estimate the total monthly expenditure.
        Therefore even though the main purpose of the initiative was to monitor the consumption, it was transformed so that it could also monitor and verify our partners charges and invoices. Since adaptation the application has proven successful in doing so, as during all following months did brought to surface small to wide inconsistencies among partners charges and our evaluations.
        </p>
        </span>
        <p>
        Moreover the data increment was expected to provide us with augmented input for exploration and exploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the background, the application is closely related with an MS Excel table that hosts in an explicit format the consumption of resources made by the company. The Excel file is filled by the user, who upon completion can move to the MS Access environment enabled either to:
        <ul>
        <li>
        Monitor the monthly resources consumption, within the use of chart diagrams
        </li>
        <li>
        Monitor the monthly expenditure, within a report statement
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
        In both cases, the previewing can either be summarised or distinct with explicit information for each service.
        The partner’s charging statement could then be crosschecked with the applications summarised expenditure report and any diverse outcomes could be examined extensively.

        <li>  Take seriously into account the due date of each assignment

        </li>
        <li>  Maintain date-time registry of the actual recording made
        </li>
        <li>  Maintain control button for “new”, “save”, “delete” recordings and “refreshing” the actual table due to changes made in the back-end
        </li>
  </span>
  </ul>
  <u> Two Additional buttons: </u>
        <ul>
        <li> One button to preview a report with the assignments that were requested for the following dates, but also for those that are pending from previous dates (highlighted).
        </li>
        <li> Second button would delegate to enable the ms-outlook ‘sent mail’ functionality, and attach the next day’s report and send it to
        the supervisor so that he/she should be informed.
        </li>
        </ul>

  <p><u>Additional Benefits</u></p>
        <ul>
        <p>Employing such a database application would empower the department also to: </p>
        <li>1. Keep the supervisor informed about the next day’s schedule, so that where emerging assignments were requested could respond effectively.
        </li>
        <li>2. Explore those departments that we frequently missing to inform us about their critical assignments, so that we could potentially request back for their conformance.
        </li>
        <li>3. While working with the system enough we would collect enough data to underline out those day’s that our department would be most likely to have greater traffic, so that we could be prepared.
        </li>
        <li>4. Address any prospective conflicts with the departments about past day of the schedule
        </li>

 <span><p>‘Innovation Club’ was an Initiative that was taken by the HR department of the company and was announced to all employees at a specific day. </p>
<p>The key concept that laid behind this announcement was the fact that the company motivated it’s employees to identify any major drawbacks on its daily business routines and suggest their ideas to the administrators for overcoming any prospective barriers. </p>
<p>This was a huge project that was undertaken by the HR department and included several meetings amongst directors of the company and external advisors. </p>
 </span>
<p>My part in this workload was to design and dress up visually the campaign of the HR department, both for digital and printable mediums. Therefore I participated in gatherings with an external advisor that kept the full picture of the initiative and who would need to pass me a number of perspectives of the idea, so that I could come up with a visual representation of the logo, banners and video animations. </p>

 <p>An electronic leaflet distributed by the Facility Security & HSE Department, with an intention of being delivered to all employees of the company via email on a 3 month basis. Context of the paper would conclude up information regarded relevant to the department’s original scope and principals.</p>
 <p>The driving concept beneath the newspaper was for the department to establish an active communication port with the members of the company, broadcasting informative and alerting messages for precaution but within a joyful environment, thus more readable for the audience.</p>

       <p>The program is a small application that stores the records for multiple users while they submit to its main application window.
        For each user the application should be in place to store information such as the user IP, user name etc.
        Some of the inputs are of significant value and the program needs to secure that they are filled appropriately with valid inputs, as also to secure that they will not be disregarded and remain blank by users. </p>
        <ul>
        <span>
        <li> The program obtains that no duplication of values is allowed for inputs such as the user IP and user name.
        </li>
        <li>The port inputs must be designed in a way that they shall deliver valid port numbers for registration, not surpassing the number of 65.536, as neither contains inappropriate text characters.
        </li>
        <li>Same port numbers can be used among different users, while the program needs to obtain that no port number is allowed to be used twice by the same user. Nevertheless, if a port input is omitted by a user this will not have any defect to the application and the user will be registered.
        </li>
        <li>The application will allow a certain number of users to be registered and the program provides notification that informs dynamically the number of registered users.
        </li>
        <li>A user that has applied erroneous data will be escaped from registered and the count want run is such case.
        </span>
        Pop-up windows alert and inform the users of prospect conflicts traced by the system while also a valid path that should be followed in order to resolve those conflicts.
        </li>
        <li>A false action by the user will prevent him from registering. At the same time the application will rather leave correctly applied inputs intact and will provide instructions how to correct those values that generated the conflict.
        In case where all inputs where applied conformingly, the system will make the registration and following will clear all previous data from the inputs.
        </li>
        <li>If the user feels the need to clear the inputs before submitting, there is a button signed as “clear” that can take away all input values with a click.
        </li>
        <li>By the time that the number of allowed registered users reaches the limit, the systems informs that no further records can be applied and the “submit” button becomes disabled and blurred, implying that no further call can be applied further. Instead a new button “statistics” is enabled and prompts the user to trigger.
        </li>
        <li>Firing the “Statistics” button invokes the system to output a new window that hosts a table with records stored within for all users.</li>
        <li>At the top of the window there is a certain section where the user is prompted to search for a specific port number currently in use. Clicking the ‘search’ button will generate a query in the background and the results will be displayed in a pop-up window.

        <p>The demonstration following provides both textual and visual information for the site navigation and at the same time the functionality that is implemented and running behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <ul>
        <p>The portal provides a minimum functionality level that creates impact for three distinct role categories of users. As of those:
        </p>
        <li> First group figures the users that enter the site to gain information on selling products
        </li>
        <li> Second group figures users that are leaded by the idea to acquire products and therefore need to become registered members of the portal.
        </li>
        <li> Third is the group of authorized users. Those are credited members of the company and obtain the capacity to maintain the products database and the previewing of the products, while also handle user registrations and design benefits for the registered users
        </li>
        </span>
        </ul>
        <p>Throughout the report there is a detailed description for all user groups and their experience with the site, while also the functions that lie underneath each group.

      <p>The report describes the design, development and further the functionality of the media player that created with the use of current trend of Rapid Application Development philosophy. The concept of RAD programming consists of developing and advancing applications within powerful IDE components like Microsoft Visual Studio. Such IDEs retaining the faculty and qualify developers with consistent and optimized functional components that can be embedded to applications visually and can be configured extensively.
        </p>
        <p>The application is build totally hardcoded with the use of C# language and some of its popular libraries. Some of the functional features that are enabled by the media player are:
        </p>

      <p>The report describes the development of a simple GUI application in Matlab IDE environment. </p>
      <span>
        <p>The key concept behind this application is to design an interface with Matlab coding that will enable a user to index sound files located in the host’s directory, load them and finally ‘plot’ them in a live chart board. Additionally the application will provide preconfigured filters that can be appended on the sound file and either distort or stabilize their sound.
        </p>
        <p>The application incorporates some of the fundamental procedures met in the majority of application developments.
        </p>
        <ul><p>As some of those are </p>
        <li> Browsing activity in the directories of the host system </li>
        <li> Choosing and loading specific file formats on the application</li>
        <li> Providing interaction for the user regarding the loaded file.</li>
        </ul></span>
        <p>A range of powerful facilities, provided by the Matlab IDE, are programmed accordingly as to provide users with the capacity to submit filtering functionality on loaded sound files and overcome inefficiencies encountered in the original one.

      <p>The report describes the procedure of taking a corrupted raw set of data in MS Excel format and apply numerous modifications upon, transforming it to a valid dataset able to provide us with classification and prediction rules.</p>

        <p>The procedure starts, with the given dataset on a spreadsheet format that initially needs to be preprocessed through several preliminary modifications. The applications that are used during this phase modifications are MS Excel and MS WordPad. Finishing the activity the file should be converted into ‘csv’ or ‘arff’ format and become appropriate for insertion in a data mining tool.</p>

        <p>The data mining tool is WEKA application. Within the WEKA application we will continue to preprocess the data and attributes of the dataset with diverse techniques in a way to construct a more effective model for prediction.
        Finishing the preprocessing section, the model will be regarded ready for starting to actually appending on it predictive algorithms build in the WEKA application.</p>
        <ul> <p>Amongst those we choose to qualify on, are:</p>
        <span>
        <li> “Decision Tables” </li>
        <li> “M5 Rules”</li>
        <li>  “J48”</li>
        <li> “Bayes Net” </li>
        </span>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Eventually some of the above models will enforce us to attempt making predictions for a class attribute of a new data set.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the entire exploration, the cases will be analyzed extensively through textual and visual mediums of contents.

     <span>The student work stands out for clarity. All phases of the assignment (data cleaning, data conversion, pre-processing, classification, forecasting) were performed and described in a remarkably clear and systematic manner. The report structure and presentation is excellent. </span> A minor point: For increased readability of the Table of Contents, please use shorter. Section titles. The  Conclusion summarizes the student’s work. It does not provide a  critical evaluation of the data mining process as experienced by the student during the assignment.

      <p>The report undertakes a case scenario where a director of a company has requested to employ a file hosting application for his/her business and has referred to us for developing a database plan that will stand out for the idea. </p>
        <span>
        <p>The first section introduces the proposed database design along with descriptive information for the entities that compose it for pulling out and covering the director’s requirements effectively.
        At the end of the section some complementary entities will be proposed from us to the director for upgrading the project’s operation. </p>
        <p>The second section induces the actual development of the database using the “Oracle Database Developer”. Creation of tables, application of the essential constraints and loading of plain data for the entities dominates the section.
        At the end of the section there is the appropriate testing performed, as it was imposed by the director in the message.</p>
        <p> The third section covers the implementation of specific advanced queries that will be used by the administrator of the database to address and monitor the recorded data.</p>

 <p>Manos Zalokostas has placed significant effort on this first coursework assignment.
      His descriptions develop the background of the topic well, although his descriptions
      in English do not present the topic concisely. However, the message within his
      descriptions is correct.  </p>
      <p>The only issue with the content is that it has limited consideration of “What did the
      developers of the technology do to try and make the transition to it better / simpler?“ which was
      a question that was presented in the assignment description to be considered as part of
      the essay task. However, he has brought together concepts with a broader
      consideration than the main suggested questions, relating the development of
      computer programming languages to social impact, and that such impact will be
      greater as the development of programming languages continues towards greater
      levels of abstraction. </p>
      <p>He has provided material that shows that he made notes from the references he used,
      and that these notes were used to help him develop a plan regarding the content of the
      essay. My review of the references that he used suggests that most of the wording
      used in the construction of the essay is his own. His references include texts that are
      not accessible simply through accessing internet sites and are some of the more
      significant texts covering the topic. </p>
      <p>My personal discussions with Manos on this topic show that he has benefited from
      this research exercise and that he is motivated to learn about such interesting topics. <span> I am very satisfied with his performance. His enthusiasm for the topic shows from the quality of his work and my personal discussions with him </span>. </p>
     <ul><p>
  My recommendations are: </p>
     <li> Marks for working notes (out of a possible 30%) : 30% - A thorough set of working
      notes was provided. </li>
      <li>Marks for essay (out of a possible 70%) :  65%.</li>

 <p> Manos Zalokostas provides a well composed product concept development and places it within a significantly well developed business proposal. </p>
 <p> He has placed significant work to research the technical considerations that affect the market and the market potential in order to quote “real numbers”
  than use a simpler estimation process, even though the lecturer suggested that simple estimation process for his particular scenario.
  This led Manos to spend more effort than was really required to complete this assignment, but he admitted that his interest in the topic caused him to get carried away.
  Since he did this extra work, Manos has exposed himself to wider considerations than this assignment had intended but his lecturer is able to appreciate from his submission
  and from discussions with him that he has truly learned practical research-quality skills that he will benefit from. </p>
  <p>He has presented the market niche and product concepts succinctly. </p>
 <p>  He has considered the requirements for the product and service that he suggests. He has considered the variations of how the service could be provided;
   leading to an optimum form. His considerations cover the balance between the service variety of e-learning topics, the likely demand and capacity factors that limit the ability
   to deliver the service. He has that a mix of content delivery would be appropriate, including videos (it is not certain whether this is real-time or downloaded in delivery from his text)
   and other online material. </p>
 <p>Manos used “above-average” quality English throughout his report. He has used an appropriate report structure.
   Significantly, Manos has provided a large body of references that support his technical and business focus. </p>
 <ul>
      <li>Lecturer recommendations are: FINAL MARK = 90%</li>
      <li>Marks for presentation (out of a possible 10) : 0/10</li>
      <li>Marks for working notes (out of a possible 30) : 30/30 - A thorough set of working notes was provided, running to 32 pages!
   Significantly, these notes document his progression of thought and questions he is considering about the topics.  </li>
      <li>Marks for essay (out of a possible 60) :  60/60 -  The information provided in the report is of sufficient depth to believe that the market niche exists
   and can be serviced by the “optimal form of product” that Manos proposes. Many aspects of the technical considerations are put into context with real-world problems in order to arrive
   at the considered optimal service form. The length of the report is excessive but reflects the completeness and professional approach to providing in-depth researched information on the topic. </li>
 </ul>

 <p><span>This assignment has proved to be a useful learning vehicle for Manos, beyond all expectations and requirements. His enthusiasm for learning is obvious by his general approach to his assignments </span>
   but Manos should take note of the advice of the lecturer to moderate his enthusiasm, taking into consideration the learning objectives of an assignment and the “required level of effort” to achieve
   these objectives. </p>

The resources will be shared among the students and the academic staff of a College (User authentication and authorization is performed by the build platform and is beyond the scope of this system). </p>
  <p>The database of the system should keep track of Users, Resources and Tags. A ternary relationship between these 3 entities has been modeled using a bridge relation ‘UserResourceTag’. </p>
  <p>The database for this activity should be completely designed and hardcoded using the ‘oracle developer’ IDE and provide screenshotss of the process. </p></span>
  <ul><p>Therefore the report further describes the design and development of:</p>
  <li> Entities, Attributes, Constraints</li>
  <li> Modifications to the entities</li>
  <li> Insertion of data</li>
  <li> Maintenance of the data</li>
  <li> Display of selection queries</li>

</ul>

<p>The second section of the report issues a table with mixed attributes that needs to break down to distinct entities using ‘normalization’ to the 3-rd normal form, and there are diagrams provided that describe the procedure.

 <li>Introduction and Conclusion of the report:Very good their initiative to include their notes in order to show evidence about their work and effort. </li>
 <li>Evidence and validity of business strategy:They have a well-designed strategic plan along with specific objectives for the future of the company</li>
 <li><span>Analysis of Business Environment and SWOT analysis:Very thorough analysis of the business micro and macro environment including SLEPT analysis and Porter's 5 forces. All these were very good interpreted into the SWOT analysis of the company.</li><li>Use of marketing concepts Fantastic analysis of the target audiences (consumers’ audit) and a very thorough marketing mix to support the suggested strategy and business objectives. Also, very good use of pull and push strategies.</span> </ul>
 <li>Application and validity of accounting and finance analysis:Very precise and quite valid financial plan and a four-year sales forecast create a clear picture of the financial aspects of the company. They have not used best and worst case scenarios. Very well formed profit and loss statement, while for the break-even point analysis there was a debate during the presentation about the existence of variable costs. Nevertheless, the use of two methods of capital investment (payback method and net present value) is a plus. </li>
 <li>Overall quality of report:The overall structure is very good, but the disadvantage is the lack of an introduction and a conclusion. Also, it is written in good and relatively concise English. </li>

  <p>The report explores one of the most popular and <span>hazardous application security attacks that is closely related to databases and SQL coding implementations; SQL Injection.</p>
  <p>Initializing the report there is a brief reference on some of the most familiar characteristics of this specific attack followed by the patterns that are used to intervene on applications development code and take control of their function. </p>

  <p>An enumeration of the accredited best practices that could be recruited as precaution measures to the attack will follow along, accompanied with short but meaningful examples. Embedding those measures - more likely in conjunction - to our applications, will certainly enlist security to defend over an SQL Injection attack. </p>
  <p>At the end of each security technique described, there is complementary information about the common drawbacks the methodology might experiences as well. </p>

 <p>During this 3rd step we are moving to the ‘design’ of the project. Therefore we actually we need to illustrate the function of the e-commerce application that will help us later to implement. </p>
 <p>Analysis for the user requirements, the functional requirements and the non functional requirements of the project in more depth is the key feature in this phase. Also a more clear view and wider perspective on how the system behaves in certain cases, as those are affected by the diverse user roles interacting with the system.</p>

 Amongst other, the issues that are further examined while documenting the design of the project are:
 <li> Simple and Complex scenarios and how those are handled by the system</li>
 <li> Use Cases</li>
 <li> Sequence Diagrams</li>
 <li> Application requirements with diagrams </li>
 <li> Functional requirements</li>

<p>During this 4TH step we are moving to the actual ‘implementation’ of the project. </p>
<p>Therefore during this report we are about to demonstrate the functionality implemented on the web portal. The portal was developed upon making use of “Joomla!” development tool. This phase also includes the ‘testing’ of the product by showcasing how the functionality that has been arranged by stakeholders can now be verified. Additionally, this last report is also a handy guiding manual. Therefore front-end and, back-end users, reading this document can acknowledge of how to make an effective use of the web tool.</p>
<p>Streaming procedures are demonstrated within the use of both textual and visual material (screenshotss) and reference the portal’s functionality to readers, confiding that the system incorporates most of current trend services found on the web today.</p>
<ul>
<span>
<p> Amongst other, the functionality described verifies: </p>
<li> Core functionality for the domains of: Information, Communication, e-Commerce <li>
<li> User communication: Article releases, RSS feeds, Calendar, Newsletters</li>
<li> User Registration</li>
<li>Products Availability, Search, Shopping Cart</li>
<li>Forums, Polls</li>

 E-learning system delivered for Pearson USA, totally consisting by Javascript-Jquery and JSON folded data. During a short-time period that I have been occupied for CSSEducation company I have delivered a demo of the Javascript engine. Its operation is described below:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <span>
  <li>Design a Json string-patterned API that plain users would need to issue for giving instructions to Javascript engine.</li>
  <li>Following the pattern-instructions, Javascript engine distincts and allocates page content as: </li>
  <li> •  Interactive Page Title and Page Description on top of the page, </li>
  <li> •  Interactive Page Content Description on the left of the page, </li>
  <li> •  Main Interactive Content on the right, </li>
  <li> Main Content issues most of interactivity addressed as: </li>
  <li> •  Aligns multiple interactive paragraph examples along with their functionality-initializing handlers</li>
  <li> •  Paragraph content-parts come preformated with styles, according to user instructions issued by the API</li>
  <li> •  Paragraph parts deliver text animating effects</li>
  <li> •  Paragraph handlers mostly issue video/audio emerging events</li>
  <li> •  Audio/Video events are synchronized with prioritized text animating effects</li>
  <li> •  Handler events bring paragraphs to the original preformated state and immediately address the anime</li>
  <li> •  A variety of text animating effects are addressed, regarded to API issued instructions</li>
  </span>

  Company's Employee Management systems build with the power of MVC, Yii Framework, that extends to thousands lines long functionality. The system mainly implements PHP, MySQL, JQuery and multiple Javascript plugins like
  Bootstrap for CSS, Ajaxplorer file sytems, Lightbox and more. During a short time period that I was employeed for the company I have delivered the following results:
  </p>
  <ul>
  <span>
  <li>1. Plan an all-over from-scratch design for measuring employees monthly workhours. The legacy design had to be upgraded so that we could now count each working second instead of simply adding the succeeding hours.
  The proccess revealed erronous deliverables granted by the legacy workhour counter. The new design delivered accurate-to-second results, taking into perception each correlation among the business rules listed above: </li>
  <li> • DateZone Type: Simple Day - Holiday/Sunday.</li>
  <li> • ShiftZone Type : Plain Shift (8 Hours) - OverHour (81 Hour) - ExtraHours (9+ Hours).</li>
  <li> • HourZone Type: Morning - Night .</li>
  <li>2. Moreover the Shifts display, figured on an Interactive Board, would now need to visually alert Administration when the following conflicts occured: </li>
  <li> • Employees were prohibited from taking a Shift 12 Hours before their last Shift</li>
  <li> • Employees would need to follow a "5-2" Shifts Rule, issuing 5 working days and 2 Dayoffs during a week long time period</li>
  <li>3. An application migration to a new Host Server that brough various mulfunctions to extension plugins operation</li>
  <li>4. A major front-end facelift update, conforming the visual display to latest CSS3 standards with overall Crossbrowser Compatibility efficiency</li>
  </span>
  </ul>

 <h3>Contracted as standalone Full Stack Developer to partner with an assigned American coordinator that would guide me through development tasks by providing the respective business requirements. Daily web meetings.</h3>

 <p>The overall objective was to upgrade, extend and maintain a legacy CRM commercial system that was build on top of PHP legacy constructs.

 My role was to make the app portable by detaching all hardcoded paths of the project from the server, invoke svn versioning, launch on an updated server and afterwards extend with new features.
 <br />
  The project was large, consisting of more than 500 DB tables and the lack of any viable coding formation to separate diverse technologies was making it difficult to maintain.
  <br />
 The result was to work on the same page with all mixed-up  on  thousand-lined pages.
 </p>

<h4>Main Developments</h4>
<ul>
<li>Put application under SVN Versioning control</li>
<li>Provide portability: Unroot the project that was harcoded  on the host and move all configuration data and links to custom-made external '.ini' configuration,</li>
<li>Install and setup a Centos 5 copy of the Production to run as Staging environment and perform tests before updates publishing to Production.</li>
<li>Set up a Ubuntu-based virtual 'Local' and Centos-based remote 'Staging' hosts to deploy and test application before move on 'Production'</li>
<li>Set up a clone virtual machine (vbox) for development environment</li>
<li>Implement Utility classes and a Core class, with MVC-like capabilities, as a root class to extend and inherit all essential activities for the newly invoked classes afterwards.</li>
<li>Amongst others, newly initialized child classes, would genuinely have access to: Main and own Configuration, Database storage, Session storage, Access Restrictions, Self-Debug, Debug-Logs, Exceptions, Helper methods, and more.</li>
<li>Synchronize 2 legacy Calendar libraries (1 php, 1 js) with Exchange Web Services (EWS) to enable control over Microsoft Calendar Events, User Tasks, Emails, Contacts etc</li>
<li>Launch time evaluated,filtered, charts for performance auditing Employees / Teams / Managers / Directors</li>
<li>Enforce 90-Days expiring passwords for all users, validated with unique tokens and time restricted activation boundaries,</li>
</ul>

<li>Build common and explicit PHP helper structures to make development lifecycle natively simple and secure</li>
<li>
<p>
Build a configurable, Javascript CORS widget for displaying best price of an affiliate hotels.</p>
 <br />- A new REST-like, PHP API build to accommodate the exchange of CORS data consumed by widget
 <br />- The widget travels from Cosmores to customer site in string formate and then self-installed with included javascript launcher
 <br />- The widget is build with vanilla Js and plain CSS in order to avoid confiict with installed Jquery / Bootstrap or own site styles
 <br />- The widget is compatible with IE 8, Safari, Chrome etc
 <br />- The widget is fully controllable and customizable from respective backend app.
 </p>
 </li>
<li>Put the application under GIT versioning and create a master repository on a remote server</li>
<li>Create a portable, local virtual clone (vbox) of the Production environment server, so that development and testing activities</li> restrain from Production.</li>
<li>
<p>Leverage the security processes overall:
<br /> - Leverage the security of entry by blocking the front entrance and allow only recognizable devices to log in. The activity uses expirable tokens that are only accepted for limited amount of time, and provide respective messages to users for guidance.
 <br />- Enforce strong passwords with mixed char types and length
 <br />- Leverage the encryption/decryption procedures for all sensitive data in the DB, which led to more than 1M rows update
 <br />- Enforce a finite number of times informative data can be displayed before locked for ever
 <br />- Leverage the restriction rules for image uploads and malicious code indexing methods
 <br />- Invoke sanitize/filtering on data import/display respectively
 <br />- Enforce PDO with MySQL inserts
 <br />- Make extensive use of .httaccess for filtering urls, root and child directories with explicit rules for each
 </p>
 </li>
</ul>

<h3>Employed as standalone Frontend Developer to build fully customizable UI widgets and the backend configuration app  in association with a backend data api developer.</h3>

<p>
The objective was to create a new product that would explore the potentials of UI widgets and thus enter a new market for the company
<br />
My role as a Frontend developer was to create the independable CORS empowered Javascript widgets that would load on affiliate sites. The widgets should invoke the latest Js trends, load on sites without causing or receiving Js / CSS defects and should be as lightweight as possible restraining from vaguely loading countless libraries. Additianally I was attached to build the backend configuration application.
</p>

<h4>Main Developments</h4>

<u>FRONTEND WIDGETS</u>
<ul>
<li>Design and develop the app's Installer that can be used on affiliate sites with a single HTML “Head”entry</li>
<li>Design and develop decoupled SPA widgets, that reside on their own domains and can be launched by installer on demand</li>
<li>
<p>
Publish 5 distinct widget types, with 4 viewport layouts for each, to accommodate diversity of screen displays:
<br /> - Price checks::          Integrates calendar that helps users check hotel prices per accommodation and compare with major booking channels
 <br />- Active offers::          Registered offers can be displayed with a user click
 <br />- Notifications::          Intresting metrics, in the form of notifications are displayed on sites screen
 <br />- Popup offers::          Offers can popup on user display at navigation time, based on submitted configuration
</p>
</li>
<li>Utilize the latest React 16.8 build and make use of powerful features like Hooks, Code splitting, Lazy loading, Context api, Dynamic imports etc</li>
<li>Make extensive use of cache so that widgets restrain from excessive calls to the remote service</li>
<li>Structure the development environment with NodeJs, Webpack, Babel etc</li>
</ul>
<br />
<u>BACKEND APPLICATION</u>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create a React 16.4 application based on a helper theme with some main group activities
<br />- Configuration domains per widget
<br />- Metrics and evaluation of widget usage
<br />- Main Dashboard, Install and more..
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The widgets configuration includes
<br />- Configurable, on screen, positioning
<br />- Configurable colors and literals
<br />- Configurable activation / deactivation periods
</p>
</li>
</ul>
