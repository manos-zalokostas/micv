        <h3>Employed as standalone Frontend Developer to build fully customizable UI widgets and the backend configuration app in association with a backend data api developer.</h3>
        <p> The objective was to create a new product that would explore the potentials of UI widgets and thus enter a new market for the company <br> My role as a Frontend developer was to create the independable CORS empowered Javascript widgets that would load on affiliate sites. The widgets
            should invoke the latest Js trends, load on sites without causing or receiving Js / CSS defects and should be as lightweight as possible restraining from vaguely loading countless libraries. Additianally I was attached to build the backend configuration application. </p> <h4>Main
