                        <p>
                            On site you may resume both of my occupational and educational timelines, how the two were
                            drawn and evolve in parellel during previous years. Context may be indexed in detail,
                            either as bulleted descriptions or guided by an interactive timeline. Along with the
                            descriptive context you may also have an overview on some of the most critical projects that
                            I have encountered.
                            Therefore you may find available work-samples while working as a freelance developer on the
                            Web, as officer occupied by pharmaceutical company, and last but not least as student at
                            university.
                            For the latter you may additionally index the scores attained, instructorsâ€™ comments, while
                            also documentation and video reference whenever appropriate.
                            Finally on the last page there are available links to the officials sites for each cited
                            organization. You are suggested to request for reference where available. If you wish you
                            may contact me
                            using any of my personal accounts provided for some of the most popular social networks.
                            Please suggest the context if you feel like.
